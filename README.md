# Spam Email Detection Using ML and NLP

---

## **Project Description**  
The **Spam Email Detection** project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. The project preprocesses email text data, trains a Naive Bayes classifier, and offers an interactive user interface for real-time email classification. 

The system simplifies spam detection by automating the classification process and protecting users from unwanted or malicious emails. A clean and intuitive user interface is built using **Streamlit**.
